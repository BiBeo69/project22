AI-TECH MEDICAL LAB is a personal experimental site created by a high school student. 
It shows how modern AI can be used to explain medical ideas, but it never replaces real doctors, real hospitals or official medical tools.

My name is Pham Minh Son. I am a grade 12 Informatics student at Hanoi – Amsterdam High School for the Gifted.

I built this website using HTML, JavaScript and a simple backend that connects to modern AI models. The idea is to create a small “lab” where people can play with medical concepts, upload images and see how an AI assistant like Doctor Cal explains things in simple English.

Medicine has been a long-time passion for me. At the same time, I enjoy programming and exploring cutting-edge AI. This project is my way of bringing those two interests together: using AI to experiment with medical topics in a safe, clearly educational environment.

Every tool in this lab is for learning only. Nothing here is a real diagnosis, treatment recommendation or medical device. The goal is to help people understand ideas a bit better, and maybe inspire more students to explore both medicine and technology.

If you would like to contact me about this project, share feedback or discuss ideas, you can email: phamminhson08@gmail.com.

Thank you for visiting AI-TECH MEDICAL LAB and spending time with Doctor Cal.
